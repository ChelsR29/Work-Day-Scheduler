# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

With this project the user can enter tasks in the time blocks provided (from 9am to 5pm). The time blocks are color coded (grey - past, red - present, green - future). When a user clicks the save button, the data will be saved into their local storage and a message will appear under the header stating so. This project was built to help me better understand third party APIs. More specifically, I learned how to work with jQuery and bootstrap.
